#create a bash script that accepts directory paths as arguments.
#For each arguments, list the contents of each
#directory with the name of each listed at the top.

#If you want to give yourself an added challenge,
#have your script accept an additional argument, "a" or "d" 
#that sorts the contents of each directory
#in either ascending or descending order.
#For even more of a challenge,
#create bash script that sorts the contents of the directories based on an "a" or "d"
#argument that directly precedes it.
#In other words, you should be able to sort one directory in ascending order,
#a second directory in descending order and so on.
